# Description:
This version of the Barky bookmarking application implements the Unit of Work pattern, ensuring that all database operations are part of a single transaction that either fully succeeds or fails completely.

# Dependencies:
The application requires Flask and SQLAlchemy to be installed, along with the Barky bookmarking application.

# Instructions:
To run the application:

# Ensure Python 3.6+ and pip are installed.
Clone the repository and navigate to the application directory.
Install required dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the application using python app.py.
Unit of Work Pattern:
The Unit of Work pattern is employed to handle transactions, with a context manager ensuring the atomicity of each business operation. It is part of the service layer and wraps the repository calls.

# Testing:
Run the test suite with python -m unittest discover. The tests check that the Unit of Work correctly commits or rolls back transactions in response to business operations.
